Repository for the Context Server REST API specification

[Open] (http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergehuber/contextserver-rest-api/master/cxsSwagger.yaml) the Swagger YAML file in the editor Online

## GraphQL schema

The `cxs-schema.graphqle` contains a GraphQL schema.

We recommend editing this file with a schema-aware editor. If you're using IntelliJ IDEA you can install this plugin
to get support for GraphQL : [https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/] (https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/)

Looks like we will need the [GraphQL Endpoint language] (https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/issues/15) support for this type of document.
